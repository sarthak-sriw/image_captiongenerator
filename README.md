## Image Caption Generator
It is a challenging artificial intelligence problem where a text description must be generated for a given photograph.
It requires both method from field of Computer Vision(CNN) to understand the content of the image and a language model from the field of Natural Language Processing to turn the understanding of image into words in right order.

We have used ### Flicker8k dataset ###. This dataset consists of two files :
- Flickr8k_Dataset.zip (1 Gigabyte) An archive of all photographs.
- Flickr8k_text.zip (2.2 Megabytes) An archive of all text descriptions for photographs
